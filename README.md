# # Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview:
- In this project amazon reviews on the differnt ratings for differnt video games and used Pyspark to perform the ETL process. Going to connecting to the database that was generated for me through the AWS webserver to extract the data. Hopefully With this data I am trying to see if there is any bias from the Vine members of our data set. Another extract is to see hoe many reviews for video games and how many are 5 star

## Results: 
- Total of of 4,291 vine reviews in our dataset, and 40,471 non-vine reviews in the final dataset.
